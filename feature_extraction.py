    We can use pretrained networks to kinda extract more abstract features. The 
    problem is that they have a very specific input format: (3 x H x W), where 
    H and W are expected to be at least 224. The 3 obviously stands for the 3 rgb 
    channels.
    Thus we neet to restructure our hyp-spec data into that format.
    Idea 1: just use all bandwidths of one class and put them under each other
    Idea 2: put the average of a class N times under each other
    Idea 3: multiply the average bandwith of a class with itself, sothat a matrix 
    results.
